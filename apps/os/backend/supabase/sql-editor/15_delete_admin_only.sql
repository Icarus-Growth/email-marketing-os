-- SQL editor paste 15 of 17: 0016_delete_admin_only.sql
-- Paste all of this into the Supabase SQL editor and press Run.
-- Wait for "Success" before you paste the next file.

-- =============================================================================
-- 0016  Only an Owner or Admin can delete a row that deletes other rows
--
-- Before: lock_table's team_all rule lets every team member delete. Deleting a
-- client also deleted all of its work (cards, calls, numbers, documents, forms),
-- because those rows are joined to it with "on delete cascade". A Member could
-- wipe a client's whole history with one call.
--
-- Now: a table that other rows cascade from refuses a delete by a signed-in
-- person who is not an Owner or Admin, with a plain message. Members still
-- read, add and change rows as before. Archive (0010) is still the normal way
-- to take a client out of use; nothing in the OS deletes.
--
--   * delete_admin_only(): the guard. The server (secret key) and the SQL
--     editor are not checked, so delete_examples.sql still works.
--   * guard_delete(tbl): adds the guard to one table. Safe to run twice.
--   * lock_table() now also guards every table the locked table cascades from,
--     so a table made later (an Interview file, a new board) is covered too.
--   * Every table that has one now (clients; documents; flows and
--     campaign_calendars in email marketing) gets the guard below.
