-- 0019  Live cards are not stuck and not late
--
-- 0018 (made per agency type) keeps live and waiting cards open, and marks
-- them with v_open_cards.is_live. Nobody has to act on them today. So:
--   * v_stuck_cards and v_late_cards leave them out;
--   * v_team_load counts them as open cards, but not as late cards;
--   * v_clients_attention does not count them as stuck or late.
-- They still show on My Work, on their board, and in the open card counts.
-- Safe to run twice.
-- =============================================================================

-- These two take the new is_live column (through c.*), so they are made again.
