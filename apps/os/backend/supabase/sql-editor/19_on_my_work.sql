-- 0023  The open cards view says which cards belong on My Work
--
-- on_my_work (new, last column of v_open_cards): false for a card that stays
-- open but that nobody works on day to day. Here: a live email flow
-- ('60 - Live'). It shows on the Flows board only.
-- Every other open card is on My Work. The AI connector's "my queue" reads it.
-- The same view as in 0018 otherwise. Safe to run twice.
